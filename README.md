# Réschumé

**Réschumé** aims to create a comprehensive schema for documenting résumés.

## Goals

- Establish a consistent standard capable of representing a résumé in a versatile computer-readable manner.
- Provide base tooling to generate, manipulate and consume this raw information.
- Provide base tooling to convert this information to well-formatted human-readable documents.

## Schema

The schema follows the [2020-12 edition](https://json-schema.org/specification.html) of the [JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org). Efforts will be made to upgrade to newer versions of the specification as they are released.
